1. Alice generates ephemeral key E and sends to Bob via a secure channel
2. Alice 
	i.   generates encryption key A
	ii.  uses E to create soc E0 with index 0 and topic T at address F0 with payload pubA
3. Alice begins to watch for existence of soc E1 with index 1 and topic T at address F1
4. Bob 
	i.	 generates encryption key A
	ii.  receives ephemeral key E from Alice
	iii. uses E to reconstruct F0 and retrieves pubA
	iv.  uses E to create soc with index 1 and topic T at address F1 with payload pubA
	v.   creates a diffie-hellman shared secret S with pubA and privB
5. Alice 
	i.   notes the existence of F1 and retrieves pubB
	ii.  creates a diffie-hellman shared secret S with pubB and privA
6. Bob and Alice
	i.   create socs B0 and A0 respectively with topic S(T), index S(0) and payload S(P)
	ii.  watch for existence of A0 and B0 respectively with topic S(T) and index S(0) and use S to determine P
	iii. if index S(n) exists, look for next soc at index S(n+1)
7. (optional) Bob and Alice confirm channel by secure channel/IRL
